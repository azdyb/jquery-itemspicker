What is itemspicker?
====================

Itemspicker is a jQuery_. plugin, which helps managing selectable items. It hooks on a bunch of any DOM elements (e.g. <li>) and waits for some trigger (usually click) to toggle item's deffined class (default "selected").

Disclaimer
==========

This is my first jQuery plugin, so there's a big chance it fails to follow its convention or may even be writen wrong. Any suggestions (and patches) are greatly encouraged and will be appreciated.
